# Titanic Data Processing & Survival Prediction

A complete **Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project** built with **Python** to explore, clean, and predict passenger survival outcomes from the **Titanic dataset**.  
The project applies **Data preprocessing, Visualization, and Classification Techniques** to analyze how passenger characteristics influenced their chances of survival.

## Project Description

The **Titanic Data Processing & Survival Prediction** project explores the historical Titanic dataset to understand survival factors and build a predictive machine learning model.  
By analyzing socio-economic, demographic, and travel-related attributes, the project uncovers insights such as who was most likely to survive and why.

This project covers the complete **data science pipeline**:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Feature Engineering**  
- **Model Training & Evaluation**  
- **Visualization and Interpretation**

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical data.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Creates new variables such as family size and title extraction from passenger names.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizes relationships between gender, class, age, and survival rates.  
- **Model Building:** Implements Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.  
- **Visualization:** Provides interactive charts for demographic insights and prediction performance.
